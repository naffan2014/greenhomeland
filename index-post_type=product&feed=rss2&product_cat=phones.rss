<p>One of the world&#8217;s first 4G LTE Android smartphones, the HTC ThunderBolt 4G for Verizon Wireless takes advantage of the fastest, most advanced 4G network in America. It&#8217;s powered by a lightning-quick 1 GHz Snapdragon processor and offers a vibrantly colorful 4.3-inch Super LCD multi-touch display. Capture brilliant photos and HD 720p video with the 8-megapixel camera on the rear, and enjoy video call capabilities with the front-facing camera. And with the Android 2.2 OS, you&#8217;ll be able to experience the full Internet thanks to its support for Adobe Flash 10.1&#8211;enabling you to play games, watch videos, and more.</p>
<h3>Android Operating System</h3>
<p>The ThunderBolt 4G runs the latest Android operating system&#8211;OS 2.2 (aka, Froyo)&#8211;which provides a faster overall Android experience as well as greater multitasking capabilities. You&#8217;ll be able to receive notifications, listen to music, and even record GPS data without keeping the application open. And it features a plethora of new enhancements, including an improved onscreen QWERTY keyboard, full push corporate e-mail, and support for Adobe Flash Player 10.1 for access to the full Web. It also offers enhanced Exchange support, with Calendar syncing, Global Address Lookup, improved security, auto-discovery, and more.</p>

<p><strong>Dual-core power, beautiful screen &#8211; the Galaxy S II is the kind of sequel we like</strong></p>
<p>Considerably thinner than the original GALAXY S and rivals such as the iPhone 4 (8.49mm v 9.3mm) the GALAXY S II is stunningly light (only 117g) and packs the latest version of Android (Gingerbread).</p>
<p>The one feature most people will notice immediately is Samsung&#8217;s best ever screen; the monster 4.27-inch Super AMOLED Plus screen runs at 480 x 800 resolution, has colours visibly brighter and more vivid than other phones, better contrast and lower power consumption, and performs superbly for gaming and watching video. Plus there&#8217;s an 8.1 megapixel camera with full 1080p HD video recording, video playback at 30 frames per second and a dual-core processor, with each core running at a blistering 1Ghz for an incredibly responsive experience.</p>
